# DB::Postgres

A light-weight wrapper for Ruby connecting to Postgres servers. This gem provides an adapter for the [`db` gem](https://github.com/socketry/db). You should use the `db` gem directly as it provides a unified interface for all database adapters and contains the majority of the documentation.
